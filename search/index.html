		"title": "Brush stirs",
		"content": "Not all drum sounds are hits which can be used in the usual way described in our drum basicsarticle. One major exception are brush techniques which involve scraping thebrush across a drum head, often in a circle. If you are not sure what thislooks or sounds like, this video is a good guide.These techniques are called swirls or stirs, and for the purpose of this articlewe’ll call them stirs. As the sound changes in intensity, and the durationof the scrapes needs to fit the tempo and rhythm of the song, sampling themrequires a different approach to the usual drum hits. The two common approachesare to completely ignore this technique and not sample it at all, and to recordloops to fit various tempos.This article describes another approach. The key principle hereis that stirs are a noisy, nonlinear sound with a lot of randomness, whichmakes them very easy to crossfade or loop with no phase issues. Therefore, instead of trying to record stirs performed in a realistic way, we proposerecording long, unrealistically steady stirs with no perceptible rhythm orexpression, and then using those samples as source material for building upa musical stir.Recording the source materialFor the purposes of this example, let’s assume the source stirs are recordedat four speeds, with 1 being the slowest and 4 being the fastest. Speed 1 isslow enough that a full circle around the head of the drum is completed inmore than 4 seconds. That’s enough to fill a measure at 60 bpm and still havesome sound left, so the user can start the next stir before the previous oneends, and thus achieve a continuous sound. Speed 4 is several circles persecond, to match the speed at which the brush would be moving during the peakof an aggressive stir. Making the sound steady at this speed is a challenge.As for how long the recordings need to be, speed 1 needs to be long enoughfor the longest stir we want to be able to make. However, if tuning controlsare to be applied, it’s important to remember that pitching a sample upshortens it, so if the tuning range is to extend to one octave up, then a10-second sample is the minimum to make a 5-second stir. Speeds 3 and 4are not used thorughout the duration of a stir but only for peaks, and forthe purposes of this example they can be half the length of speed 1.Simple stir modelWe can make a very simple stir using speed 1 by playing the sample withloop_mode set to one_shot, like we normally would set it for adrum hit, and using a simple volume envelopeto fade this sample in over a time, and then fade it out.&lt;region&gt;key=26 loop_mode=one_shotsample=snare_stir_speed_1.wavampeg_attack=1.0 ampeg_decay=1.0 ampeg_sustain=0The resulting volume envelope will look something like this. The illustrations arenot precise, only general shapes.This is a good start, and we can add expression and realism by layering afaster speed on top of it near the stir’s peak, with half the durationof the base layer. We use ampeg_delay to delay the start of the secondlayer by the same amount, so the peaks of both layers align in time.&lt;region&gt;key=26 loop_mode=one_shotsample=snare_stir_speed_1.wavampeg_attack=1.0 ampeg_decay=1.0 ampeg_sustain=0&lt;region&gt;key=26 loop_mode=one_shotsample=snare_stir_speed_3.wavampeg_delay=0.5 ampeg_attack=0.5 ampeg_decay=0.5 ampeg_sustain=0Modulating stir durationThis has a fixed duration and is not flexible, but the stir length caneasily be modulated by a single CC parameter changing all theenvelope durations. Extremely short stirs, lasting only a small fractionof a second, are obviously not going to sound realistic, so we can usea minimum value to prevent that. Let’s use CC1 (standard mod wheel).&lt;region&gt;key=26 loop_mode=one_shotsample=snare_stir_speed_1.wavampeg_attack=0.1 ampeg_decay=0.1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0.4 ampeg_decaycc1=0.4&lt;region&gt;key=26 loop_mode=one_shotsample=snare_stir_speed_3.wavampeg_delay=0.05 ampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_delaycc1=0.25 ampeg_attackcc1=0.25 ampeg_decaycc1=0.25Making the shape more realisticDrummers testing the above model have asked for some adjustments tomake it sound more realistic. One is to make the first half of the baselayer steadier. This can be done very easily by shortening the attackand adding a hold time to the envelope, ensuring that they still add upto the same amount of time that the faster layer’s delay and attack,so the peak will remain aligned at all values of the modulationparameter. The attack stage should generally be shorter than the holdstage.&lt;region&gt;key=26 loop_mode=one_shotsample=snare_stir_speed_1.wavampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_hold=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0.05 ampeg_holdcc1=0.35 ampeg_decaycc1=0.4&lt;region&gt;key=26 loop_mode=one_shotsample=snare_stir_speed_3.wavampeg_delay=0.05 ampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_delaycc1=0.25 ampeg_attackcc1=0.25 ampeg_decaycc1=0.25Also, the peak should be sharper and more accented than it iswith linear envelopes. Changing the envelope curves accomplishes this,though the initial attack envelope of the base layer can remainlinear. The below values seem like a decent start.&lt;region&gt;key=26 loop_mode=one_shotsample=snare_stir_speed_1.wavampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_hold=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0.05 ampeg_holdcc1=0.35 ampeg_decaycc1=0.4ampeg_attack_shape=0.0 ampeg_decay_shape=-1.4&lt;region&gt;key=26 loop_mode=one_shotsample=snare_stir_speed_3.wavampeg_delay=0.05 ampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_delaycc1=0.25 ampeg_attackcc1=0.25 ampeg_decaycc1=0.25ampeg_attack_shape=3.5 ampeg_decay_shape=-1.4Adjusting the envelope shapesThe above fixed envelope shapes are good for medium tempos and energy levels,but for slow tempos the flat envelope shapes actually work quite well, andmore energetic tracks might sound better with even sharper envelope peaks. Itwould be nice to adjust the envelope curve shapes with MIDI CC, but it is notcurrently possible to do this. It’s possible to work around this by crossfadingsharp-envelope and flat-envelope regions, or use locc/hicc to select betweenseveral pre-baked envelope shapes. Here’s anexample of the latter method.&lt;group&gt;key=26 loop_mode=one_shot&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42sample=snare_stir_speed_1.wavampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_hold=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0.05 ampeg_holdcc1=0.35 ampeg_decaycc1=0.4ampeg_attack_shape=0.0 ampeg_decay_shape=0.0&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42sample=snare_stir_speed_3.wavampeg_delay=0.05 ampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_delaycc1=0.25 ampeg_attackcc1=0.25 ampeg_decaycc1=0.25ampeg_attack_shape=0.0 ampeg_decay_shape=0.0&lt;region&gt;locc100=43 hicc100=86sample=snare_stir_speed_1.wavampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_hold=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0.05 ampeg_holdcc1=0.35 ampeg_decaycc1=0.4ampeg_attack_shape=0.0 ampeg_decay_shape=-1.4&lt;region&gt;locc100=43 hicc100=86sample=snare_stir_speed_3.wavampeg_delay=0.05 ampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_delaycc1=0.25 ampeg_attackcc1=0.25 ampeg_decaycc1=0.25ampeg_attack_shape=3.5 ampeg_decay_shape=-1.4&lt;region&gt;locc100=87sample=snare_stir_speed_1.wavampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_hold=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0.05 ampeg_holdcc1=0.35 ampeg_decaycc1=0.4ampeg_attack_shape=0.0 ampeg_decay_shape=-3.5&lt;region&gt;locc100=87sample=snare_stir_speed_3.wavampeg_delay=0.05 ampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_delaycc1=0.25 ampeg_attackcc1=0.25 ampeg_decaycc1=0.25ampeg_attack_shape=5.2 ampeg_decay_shape=-3.5Adding ornamentsSo far, we have a stir with adjustable duration and shape which peakshalfway through. More complex patterns can have more than one peak, though. A simple way to emulate that is to use a differnet MIDI noteto trigger short ornaments which will add a brief extra sound to thestir, thus emulating a momentary acceleration of the brush. We can useone of the higher stir speeds for this.&lt;group&gt;key=27 loop_mode=one_shot sample=snare_stir_speed_2.wavampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0.2 ampeg_decaycc1=0.2&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42ampeg_attack_shape=0.0 ampeg_decay_shape=0.0&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42ampeg_attack_shape=3.5 ampeg_decay_shape=-1.4&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42ampeg_attack_shape=5.2 ampeg_decay_shape=-3.5AccentsWe can also create accents, which are similar to the typical stir but peak muchmore quickly and use faster speeds. In pracitce, they can be used either asshort, aggressive stirs, or added on top of basic stirs to create more complexpatterns. The difference in the SFZ here is that the attack curve shape can be applied tothe attack portion as well, and there is no hold stage in the envelope.&lt;group&gt;key=28 loop_mode=one_shot&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42sample=snare_stir_speed_2.wavampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0.05 ampeg_decaycc1=0.4ampeg_attack_shape=0.0 ampeg_decay_shape=0.0&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42sample=snare_stir_speed_4.wavampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0.05 ampeg_decaycc1=0.2ampeg_attack_shape=0.0 ampeg_decay_shape=0.0&lt;region&gt;locc100=43 hicc100=86sample=snare_stir_speed_2.wavampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0.05 ampeg_decaycc1=0.4ampeg_attack_shape=3.5 ampeg_decay_shape=-1.4&lt;region&gt;locc100=43 hicc100=86sample=snare_stir_speed_4.wavampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0.05 ampeg_decaycc1=0.2ampeg_attack_shape=3.5 ampeg_decay_shape=-1.4&lt;region&gt;locc100=87sample=snare_stir_speed_2.wavampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0.05 ampeg_decaycc1=0.4ampeg_attack_shape=5.2 ampeg_decay_shape=-3.5&lt;region&gt;locc100=87sample=snare_stir_speed_4.wavampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0.05 ampeg_decaycc1=0.2ampeg_attack_shape=5.2 ampeg_decay_shape=-3.5MutingAs all the above sounds have loop_mode set to one_shot, triggering a note causesthe sound to play until the volume envelope drops to zero. If ending a stirearlier than that is required, we can use polyphony groups. The group and off_byopcodes are the key ones here. We can use them to make stirs self-mute, so thattriggering a new stir will mute any previously playing stirs, as well as add a keywhich produces no sound, using silence instead of a sample, butis in the same mute groups, so triggering this key will mute any stir or accentcurrently playing. This key can be used to stop stirs early.Note that, as usual, separate groups are needed forlayers which are to play simultaneously, and if there are multiple microphonepositions then those would need separate groups as well. In the below example wealso have stirs mute accents, and vice versa, although the ornaments are leftout of the mute groups and can be layered on top of other sounds without muting them.For a more sophisticated use of mute groups with other pieces of the drum kit,please see cymbal muting.&lt;global&gt;loop_mode=one_shot off_mode=normalampeg_release=0.1 ampeg_releasecc1=0.2&lt;group&gt;key=26&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42sample=snare_stir_speed_1.wavampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_hold=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0.05 ampeg_holdcc1=0.35 ampeg_decaycc1=0.4ampeg_attack_shape=0.0 ampeg_decay_shape=0.0group=1 off_by=1&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42sample=snare_stir_speed_3.wavampeg_delay=0.05 ampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_delaycc1=0.25 ampeg_attackcc1=0.25 ampeg_decaycc1=0.25ampeg_attack_shape=0.0 ampeg_decay_shape=0.0group=2 off_by=2&lt;region&gt;locc100=43 hicc100=86sample=snare_stir_speed_1.wavampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_hold=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0.05 ampeg_holdcc1=0.35 ampeg_decaycc1=0.4ampeg_attack_shape=0.0 ampeg_decay_shape=-1.4group=1 off_by=1&lt;region&gt;locc100=43 hicc100=86sample=snare_stir_speed_3.wavampeg_delay=0.05 ampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_delaycc1=0.25 ampeg_attackcc1=0.25 ampeg_decaycc1=0.25ampeg_attack_shape=3.5 ampeg_decay_shape=-1.4group=2 off_by=2&lt;region&gt;locc100=87sample=snare_stir_speed_1.wavampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_hold=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0.05 ampeg_holdcc1=0.35 ampeg_decaycc1=0.4ampeg_attack_shape=0.0 ampeg_decay_shape=-3.5group=1 off_by=1&lt;region&gt;locc100=87sample=snare_stir_speed_3.wavampeg_delay=0.05 ampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_delaycc1=0.25 ampeg_attackcc1=0.25 ampeg_decaycc1=0.25ampeg_attack_shape=5.2 ampeg_decay_shape=-3.5group=2 off_by=2&lt;group&gt;key=27 sample=snare_stir_speed_2.wavampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0.2 ampeg_decaycc1=0.2&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42ampeg_attack_shape=0.0 ampeg_decay_shape=0.0&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42ampeg_attack_shape=3.5 ampeg_decay_shape=-1.4&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42ampeg_attack_shape=5.2 ampeg_decay_shape=-3.5&lt;group&gt;key=28&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42sample=snare_stir_speed_2.wavampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0.05 ampeg_decaycc1=0.4ampeg_attack_shape=0.0 ampeg_decay_shape=0.0group=1 off_by=1&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42sample=snare_stir_speed_4.wavampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0.05 ampeg_decaycc1=0.2ampeg_attack_shape=0.0 ampeg_decay_shape=0.0group=2 off_by=2&lt;region&gt;locc100=43 hicc100=86sample=snare_stir_speed_2.wavampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0.05 ampeg_decaycc1=0.4ampeg_attack_shape=3.5 ampeg_decay_shape=-1.4group=1 off_by=1&lt;region&gt;locc100=43 hicc100=86sample=snare_stir_speed_4.wavampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0.05 ampeg_decaycc1=0.2ampeg_attack_shape=3.5 ampeg_decay_shape=-1.4group=2 off_by=2&lt;region&gt;locc100=87sample=snare_stir_speed_2.wavampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0.05 ampeg_decaycc1=0.4ampeg_attack_shape=5.2 ampeg_decay_shape=-3.5group=1 off_by=1&lt;region&gt;locc100=87sample=snare_stir_speed_4.wavampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0.05 ampeg_decaycc1=0.2ampeg_attack_shape=5.2 ampeg_decay_shape=-3.5group=2 off_by=2&lt;group&gt;key=29 sample=*silence&lt;region&gt;group=1 off_by=1&lt;region&gt;group=2 off_by=2It is, of course, possible to apply round robins and dynamic layers to this,just like any other drum sound. That is left as an exercise to the reader.Alternative approachThe above approach was developed to be playable from an electronic drum kitcontroller. For keyboard controllers or sequencing, another approach is possiblewhere instead of using a MIDI note to trigger a new stir every time the drummerwould complete a circle, we hold down a long note for as long as we want to producestirs (so, possibly for several measures, or even the entire duration of a song).We then use MIDI CC to crossfade between the layers tomodulate the speed of the stir in order to create realism and rhythmic interest.In order to be able to do this, the samples will have to be looped, but as statedat the beginning, looping or crossfading noisy samples is very easy as there areno phase issues. We also set the loop_mode opcode to continuousinstead of the one_shot setting used in the earlier approach.&lt;group&gt;key=26 loop_mode=continuous ampeg_release=0.25&lt;region&gt;sample=snare_stir_speed_1.wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=31 xfout_locc1=32 xfout_hicc1=63&lt;region&gt;sample=snare_stir_speed_2.wav xfin_locc1=32 xfin_hicc1=63 xfout_locc1=64 xfout_hicc1=95&lt;region&gt;sample=snare_stir_speed_3.wav xfin_locc1=64 xfin_hicc1=95 xfout_locc1=96 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=snare_stir_speed_4.wav xfin_locc1=96 xfin_hicc1=127In practice, this approach has proven more difficult to use, with it being easyto sound obviously unrealistic by moving the MIDI CC parameter too quickly orstaying at high values for too long. With care, however, it can produce realisticresults, and it is extremely flexible.Further possibilitiesThe brush flutter technique can be treated similarly to the base layer of the stirs.There is no need to layer faster and slower flutters. In theory, this approachcould also be extended to other noisy, highly nonlinear sounds which can varyin duration - perhaps shakers. The main challenge there would be to record shakersshaking smoothly for an extended duration.It is also certainly possible to further improve the above model with more realismand playablity.",

		"content": "A lot of the information in this article deals with implementing sampled hi-hatsand cymbals in general, and although the code examples are in SFZ, the principlesshould also apply to other samplers, or even synthesized cymbals.Muting previously played notes is important with monophonic instruments, such asflutes or trumpets. With hi-hats, it is also crucial to sounding like a hi-hat -an open hi-hat hit will be muted in real life when the hi-hat pedal is closed.Let’s start with a simple hi-hat with closed hit, foot chik, half-open and opensamples, with the latter two on the same key and degree of openness selected byMIDI CC 4 - the common hi-hat pedal assignment in electronic drum kits.&lt;region&gt;key=42 sample=hh_closed.wav&lt;region&gt;key=44 sample=hh_chik.wav&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_half_open.wav hicc4=63&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_open.wav locc4=64Simple self-mutingThe above hi-hat has no muting implemented, so playinga closed hit after an open one would result in the open hit unrealisticallycontinuing to ring. The simplest way to take care of that is to put all theregions in the same ‹group› and use off_byto make that group mute itself - thatwill mean any hi-hat hit will mute any currently playing hi-hat hit.Setting off_mode to normal and using ampeg_releaseor off_time to set the time it takes forthe previous sample to fade out also helps this sound a bit more natural.&lt;group&gt;off_mode=normalampeg_release=0.07&lt;region&gt;key=42 sample=hh_closed.wav group=1 off_by=1&lt;region&gt;key=44 sample=hh_chik.wav group=1 off_by=1&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_half_open.wav hicc4=63 group=1 off_by=1&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_open.wav locc4=64 group=1 off_by=1Hierarchical self-mutingThis is an improvement, and is the way many virtual drum kits work, but it is notfully satisfactory if, for example, playing a ride pattern on an open hi-hat.Things do start getting more complicated here, though, and many developers feelthat it’s enough to stop here.

Jones has developed a hierarchy of muting,where chiks mute all hits, closed hits mute any partially open hits but not chiksor closed hits etc. With this amount of degrees of openness, half-open hits wouldmute open hits, and open hits would mute nothing. So, we need to put each hi-hatarticulation in a different group. This, however, means we need a group whichmutes several other groups, and regions in a group cannot have multiple orvarying off_by values. So, what we have to do is use silence - either the silence*setting of sample ARIA extension, or an actual file ofa short silence. Note that the silence samples also have to have off_by settingsthe same as the hi-hat samples in their mute group. Also, since group 1 doesn’tmute anything, we don’t need to add any silence regions to that group.Note that the group opcode used here and the ‹group›header are completely separate concepts - “group” for the remainder of thisarticle refers to the opcode, not the header, though group headers are also usedin the code examples.&lt;group&gt;// Here are the hi-hat samplesoff_mode=normalampeg_release=0.07&lt;region&gt;key=42 sample=hh_closed.wav group=3 off_by=4&lt;region&gt;key=44 sample=hh_chik.wav group=4&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_half_open.wav hicc4=63 group=2 off_by=3&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_open.wav locc4=64 group=1 off_by=2&lt;group&gt;group=2 off_by=3// The range which mutes open hi-hats - that is, everything except opensample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=46 hicc4=63&lt;group&gt;group=3 off_by=4// The range which mutes half-open and open hi-hats - that is, closed and chikloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;group&gt;group=4// The range which mutes closed, half-open and open hi-hats - that is, just chikloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=44Special treatment of foot splashesThe above isn’t perfect - for example, fully opening up a hi-hat after playinga hard half-open hit in the real world would stop the clashes between the topand bottom, effectively stopping a half-open sound - but it is a reasonablecompromise covering various degrees of openness. Also, the more degrees ofopenness there are, the more groups will be needed.There are, however, more hi-hat articulations possible. One which has specialbehavior when it comes to muting is the foot splash - closing the hi-hat withthe pedal, then quickly reopening it. This articulation needs to mute itself,because playing one foot splash after another involves closing the hi-hat, whichwill mute the ringing. It should also mute just about everything else, exceptfor possibly foot chiks, because it invovles closing the hi-hat fully. So, if akit has foot splash samples (for which there is no standard general MIDI noteassignment, so let’s use 54 here - an octave above the chik, though in generalMIDI that’s supposed to be the cowbell note), we’d need to set up one more group,and have that mute itself. It will also need to be muted by all other types ofhi-hat hits, except for fully open hits.&lt;group&gt;//Here are the hi-hat samplesoff_mode=normalampeg_release=0.07&lt;region&gt;key=42 sample=hh_closed.wav group=4 off_by=5&lt;region&gt;key=44 sample=hh_chik.wav group=5&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_half_open.wav hicc4=63 group=3 off_by=4&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_open.wav locc4=64 group=2 off_by=3&lt;region&gt;key=54 sample=hh_splash.wav group=1 off_by=1&lt;group&gt;group=1 off_by=1//The range which mutes foot splashes - everything except open and foot splash//Foot splash mutes itself, but this group does not include the foot splash key//That's because the foot splash samples themselves are in the same groupsample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=46&lt;group&gt;group=3 off_by=4//The range which mutes open hi-hats - that is, everything except opensample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=46 hicc4=63&lt;region&gt; key=54&lt;group&gt;group=4 off_by=5//The range which mutes half-open and open hi-hats - that is, closed, chik and foot splashsample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0ampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=54&lt;group&gt;group=5//The range which mutes closed, half-open and open hi-hats - that is, just chik and foot splashsample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0ampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=54Limiting polyphonyThis works reasonably well. Another potential refinement is to also avoidexcessive buildup when the more open articulations (which with some hi-hat pairscan ring for upwards of 20 seconds), while still allowing enough for ridepatterns on an open hi-hat to sound right. We can do this by using the polyphonyopcode to put a limit on the number of polyphony voices used by a specific group.Note this must be set for the silence regions, also, so that every region in agroup will have the same off_by and polyphony as all the other regions in thatgroup. Polyphony of 4 for the open hi-hats and 3 for the half-open are judgmentcalls. Drier cymbals and articulations with less sustain will generally soundrealistic with lower numbers here, and brushes might need a lower number thansticks. Limiting the polyphony for the more closed articulations is not necessaryin practice, unless playing unrealistically dense trap hi-hat patterns, becausethey don’t ring very long anyway. Limiting the polyphony for the foot splash isnot necessary at all, because it mutes itself.&lt;group&gt;//Here are the hi-hat samplesoff_mode=normalampeg_release=0.07&lt;region&gt;key=42 sample=hh_closed.wav group=4 off_by=5&lt;region&gt;key=44 sample=hh_chik.wav group=5&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_half_open.wav hicc4=63 group=3 off_by=4 polyphony=3&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_open.wav locc4=64 group=2 off_by=3 polyphony=4&lt;region&gt;key=54 sample=hh_splash.wav group=1 off_by=1&lt;group&gt;group=1 off_by=1//The range which mutes foot splashes//All sounds except open mute foot splashes, but this group does not include the foot splash key//That's because the foot splash samples are in the same group, and will mute anything elsesample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=46 hicc4=63&lt;group&gt;group=3 off_by=4 polyphony=3//The range which mutes open hi-hats - that is, everything except open and foot splashsample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=46 hicc4=63&lt;region&gt; key=54&lt;group&gt;group=4 off_by=5//The range which mutes half-open and open hi-hats - that is, closed, chik and foot splashsample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0ampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=54&lt;group&gt;group=5//The range which mutes closed, half-open and open hi-hats - that is, just chik and foot splashsample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0ampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=44Multimic samplesSo far, each hi-hat articulation has only one sample, which will obviously notbe the case in most virtual drum kits. This does not add much complexity, though,as the samples for each degree of openness simply need to all be in the same group.If there are separate articulations for each degree of openness, such as shank,tip and bell, those can also all be on the same group. Brushes, sticks andmallets can often also share the same groups, unless the brushes need lowerpolyphony numbers. However, if there are separate samples for differentmicrophones and the groups are self-muting, they will need to be in differentgroups. In the current example, only the footsplash is self-muting, but if usingthe simpler rules where all hi-hat articulations mute all others, all groups areself-muting. So, having separate close hi-hat mic and a stereo overhead pairwould mean twice as many of those groups (assuming the stereo overheads are inthe L and R channel of the same sample), and close hi-hat, stereo overheads,close room and far room would mean four times as many. The polyphony numbers forgroups which have polyphony will also have to be multiplied by the same factor.Here is an example with close and overhead, with slightly longer fadeout timesfor the more distant overhead mics:&lt;group&gt;//Here are the hi-hat samplesoff_mode=normal&lt;region&gt;key=42 sample=hh_closed_close.wav group=4 off_by=5 ampeg_release=0.12&lt;region&gt;key=42 sample=hh_closed_oh.wav group=4 off_by=5 ampeg_release=0.2&lt;region&gt;key=44 sample=hh_chik_close.wav group=5 ampeg_release=0.12&lt;region&gt;key=44 sample=hh_chik_oh.wav group=5 ampeg_release=0.2&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_half_open_close.wav hicc4=63 group=3 off_by=4 polyphony=6 ampeg_release=0.12&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_half_open_oh.wav hicc4=63 group=3 off_by=4 polyphony=6 ampeg_release=0.2&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_open_close.wav locc4=64 group=2 off_by=3 polyphony=8 ampeg_release=0.12&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_open_oh.wav locc4=64 group=2 off_by=3 polyphony=8 ampeg_release=0.2&lt;region&gt;key=54 sample=hh_splash_close.wav group=1 off_by=1 ampeg_release=0.12&lt;region&gt;key=54 sample=hh_splash_oh.wav group=11 off_by=11 ampeg_release=0.2&lt;group&gt;group=1 off_by=1//The range which mutes foot splashes for the close mic//All sounds except open mute foot splashes, but this group does not include the foot splash key//That's because the foot splash samples are in the same group, and will mute anything elsesample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=46 hicc4=63&lt;group&gt;group=11 off_by=11//The range which mutes foot splashes for the overhead mics//All sounds mute foot splashes, but this group does not include the foot splash key//That's because the foot splash samples are in the same group, and will mute anything elsesample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=46 hicc4=63&lt;group&gt;group=3 off_by=4 polyphony=3//The range which mutes open hi-hats for both close and overhead mics - that is, everything except opensample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=46 hicc4=63&lt;region&gt; key=54&lt;group&gt;group=4 off_by=5//The range which mutes half-open and open hi-hats - that is, closed, chik and foot splashsample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0ampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=54&lt;group&gt;group=5//The range which mutes closed, half-open and open hi-hats - that is, just chiksample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0ampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=44Header organizationThat is as complex as it gets, though there are a few minor points to be aware of.Many drum kits with round robins will set seq_lengthat the ‹global› level, and in those cases, the silence regionswould only trigger for the first hit in the round robin sequence, unless theyhave seq_length set to 1 to override the global setting. Also, the ‹master›header level and #include statement are useful ARIAextensions for keeping deeply sampled hi-hat mappings organized.Cymbals other than hi-hatsCymbals other than hi-hats are simpler, but there aretwo considerations when muting those. One is limiting polyphony, which isespecially important with cymbals intended for playing rolls, and with jazz ridecymbals (rock/metal rides which primarily use the bell articulation, not as much).The other is that it’s also possible to record separate choke samples, and havethose mute everything else. A ride with bell, bow and edge articulations, chokesamples and overhead and room mics might be set up like below. Note that whileeach articulation has its own groups and different polyphony limits, allarticulations for each mic have the same off_by value, which is the group valueof the choke samples for that mic. It would not be necessary to have this manygroups to implement muting, but this setup would also allow a mapping using onlythe overhead mics and no room mic to be created without breaking anything, aseach mic’s samples have separate groups. Having different polyphony numbers fordifferent mics can result in an inconsistent sound, so it is not recommended.&lt;group&gt;off_mode=normal//Bow hits&lt;region&gt;key=51 group=30 off_by=33 polyphony=5 ampeg_release=0.3sample=ride_bow_oh.wav&lt;region&gt;key=51 group=40 off_by=43 polyphony=5 ampeg_release=0.4sample=ride_bow_rm.wav//Bell hits&lt;region&gt;key=53 group=31 off_by=33 polyphony=4 ampeg_release=0.3sample=ride_bell_oh.wav&lt;region&gt;key=53 group=41 off_by=43 polyphony=4 ampeg_release=0.4sample=ride_bell_rm.wav//Edge hits (crashes)&lt;region&gt;key=59 group=32 off_by=33 polyphony=6 ampeg_release=0.3sample=ride_edge_oh.wav&lt;region&gt;key=59 group=42 off_by=43 polyphony=6 ampeg_release=0.4sample=ride_edge_rm.wav//Edge chokes&lt;region&gt;key=71 ampeg_attack=0.15 group=33sample=ride_choke_oh.wav&lt;region&gt;key=71 ampeg_attack=0.15 group=43sample=ride_choke_rm.wavAnother approach to limiting polyphonyIf there is no need have a choke group, it’s possible to limit the polyphony ofa cymbal in a way which is more controllable, by having it self-mute but makingthe fadeout time of the previous samples long. This cannot be done when chokesare required, because chokes need a fast fadeout, but it is another option whichallows how much dense patterns on a cymbal will build up to be controlled with aMIDI CC parameter - the polyphony opcode cannot be modulated by MIDI CC, butampeg_release can. Here is how that might work using CC 100 to modulate the time,with different maximum times for different articulations, as in general edge hitswill build up the most and bell hits the least. Of course, it’s not very possibleto modulate the buildup of a cymbal in the real world, but that doesn’t mean itcan’t be useful in the sampled world.&lt;group&gt;off_mode=normalampeg_release=0.1//Bow hits&lt;region&gt;key=51 group=30 off_by=30ampeg_release_oncc100=5sample=ride_bow_oh.wav&lt;region&gt;key=51 group=40 off_by=40ampeg_release_oncc100=5.7sample=ride_bow_rm.wav//Bell hits&lt;region&gt;key=53 group=31 off_by=31ampeg_release_oncc100=3sample=ride_bell_oh.wav&lt;region&gt;key=53 group=41 off_by=41ampeg_release_oncc100=3.5sample=ride_bell_rm.wav//Edge hits (crashes)&lt;region&gt;key=59 group=32 off_by=32ampeg_release_oncc100=7sample=ride_edge_oh.wav&lt;region&gt;key=59 group=42 off_by=42ampeg_release_oncc100=8sample=ride_edge_rm.wavDeep-sampled hi-hat examplePutting most of the above knowledge together into a complex example can resultin long SFZ files, but the principles themselves remain the same.

		"title": "Drum basics",
		"content": "SFZ has a lot of opcodes. No instrument uses all of them, though, and even highlycomplicated instruments with thousands of samples will usually only use a dozenor two different opcodes.In this guide, we’ll talk about the opcodes needed to make a simple drum kit.If you have some drum samples, a text editor and an SFZ player, this should beall the knowledge you need to make a working SFZ mapping for those samples.Most of them will apply to most other instrument types as well. Later, we’llapply this knowledge to instruments such as piano, guitar, violin and flute.A very simple instrument to make would be an electronic drum kit with one samplefor each sound. A functional mapping for an entire sampled drum machine usingone-shot samples could be made using only the region header, and two opcodessample and key. With kick, snareand hi-hat samples on their standard General MIDI notes, this could be theentire SFZ file:&lt;region&gt;key=36 sample=kick.wav&lt;region&gt;key=38 sample=snare.wav&lt;region&gt;key=42 sample=closedhat.wavThis would work. Load this into an SFZ player, hit the C on MIDI note 36, andyou get the kick sample playing. However, each sound would play only while anote is held. With drums it’s usually a good idea to play the entire sample, soa very short note will result in a complete drum hit sounding. We can do thatwith the loop_mode opcode, which is also used forlooping (as the name implies), but loop_mode=one_shot causes the sampler toplay the entire sample from start to end, ignoring note off.&lt;region&gt;key=36 loop_mode=one_shot sample=kick.wav&lt;region&gt;key=38 loop_mode=one_shot sample=snare.wav&lt;region&gt;key=42 loop_mode=one_shot sample=closedhat.wavThere’s no need to set the one_shot for each region, though. We can simplifyour life by using the ‹global› header like this:&lt;global&gt;loop_mode=one_shot&lt;region&gt;key=36 sample=kick.wav&lt;region&gt;key=38 sample=snare.wav&lt;region&gt;key=42 sample=closedhat.wavThis is basically all that’s required to take, for example, some ofWave Alchemy’s very nice free samples of TR-808 or Tanzbar drum machines,and make a working SFZ mapping for them.Let’s say what we have isn’t drum machine samples, but acoustic drum samples.These sounds will have natural variation between hits - some depending on hitlocation, a lot depending on dynamics (how hard the drum is hit), and some justplain random. Let’s ignore controlling hit location for now (drum samples mostlydo ignore it), and focus on the other two. Dynamic variation can be captured byrecording hits of various intensity, and organizing them into dynamic layers,also called velocity layers.If we have an acoustic kick drum sampled at four dynamics - quiet, kind of quiet,kind of loud and loud - we have four dynamic layers. Let’s say the files forthese layers are named like this:kick_vl1.wavkick_vl2.wavkick_vl3.wavkick_vl4.wavTo trigger the quiet sample at low MIDI note velocities, we’d use thelovel and hivel opcodes like this:&lt;region&gt;key=36 lovel=0 hivel=31 sample=kick_vl1.wavAll four hits with velocity ranges assigned, evenly splitting the full 0 to 127velocity range into four, would look like this:&lt;region&gt;key=36lovel=0 hivel=31sample=kick_vl1.wav&lt;region&gt;key=36lovel=32 hivel=63sample=kick_vl2.wav&lt;region&gt;key=36lovel=64 hivel=95sample=kick_vl3.wav&lt;region&gt;key=36lovel=96 hivel=127sample=kick_vl4.wavThis can, again, be simplified. The defalut value for lovel is 0, and for hivelit’s 127, so we don’t need to specify setting them to those numbers. Also, wecan use a ‹group› header to make the key opcode the sameacross all four regions:&lt;global&gt;loop_mode=one_shot&lt;group&gt;key=36&lt;region&gt;hivel=31 sample=kick_vl1.wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=32 hivel=63 sample=kick_vl2.wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=64 hivel=95 sample=kick_vl3.wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=96 sample=kick_vl4.wavHowever, the quiet samples will play quieter than they should - because ofstandard velocity tracking, each sample would play at full volume if thevelocity was 127, but we actually need each sample to play at full volume at thevelocity which is equal to its hivel value. This can be done in various ways,and the way we recommend is the amp_velcurve_Nopcode, like this:&lt;global&gt;loop_mode=one_shot&lt;group&gt;key=36&lt;region&gt;hivel=31 amp_velcurve_31=1 sample=kick_vl1.wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=32 hivel=63 amp_velcurve_63=1 sample=kick_vl2.wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=64 hivel=95 amp_velcurve_95=1 sample=kick_vl3.wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=96 sample=kick_vl4.wavLet’s say that each dynamic layer also contains four round robins - four sampleswith roughly the same dynamic. This allows us to include some variation, andsound more natural - fast parts won’t sound like a “machine gun”. There are twobasic ways to put round robins to use. One is to use the seq_lengthand seq_position opcodes, like this:&lt;global&gt;loop_mode=one_shot&lt;group&gt;key=36 hivel=31 amp_velcurve_31=1 seq_length=4&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=kick_vl1_rr1.wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=kick_vl1_rr2.wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=kick_vl1_rr3.wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=4 sample=kick_vl1_rr4.wav&lt;group&gt;key=36 lovel=32 hivel=63 amp_velcurve_63=1 seq_length=4&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=kick_vl2_rr1.wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=kick_vl2_rr2.wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=kick_vl2_rr3.wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=4 sample=kick_vl2_rr4.wav&lt;group&gt;key=36 lovel=64 hivel=95 amp_velcurve_95=1 seq_length=4&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=kick_vl3_rr1.wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=kick_vl3_rr2.wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=kick_vl3_rr3.wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=4 sample=kick_vl3_rr4.wav&lt;group&gt;key=36 lovel=96 seq_length=4&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=kick_vl4_rr1.wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=kick_vl4_rr2.wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=kick_vl4_rr3.wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=4 sample=kick_vl4_rr4.wavThat’s a kick drum with four dynamic layers and four sequential round robins.As you might have noticed, we’re repeating the key=36 and seq_length=4 opcodesin every group. Those two opcodes could be moved to the global level if all wewanted was a kick drum, but as we’re going to have other instruments with otherkeys and possibly different numbers of round robins, we kept them at the grouplevel. The other way to use round robins is randomized, using thelorand and hirand opcodes. This will make the sampleplayer generate a random number, then play the region whose lorand to hirandrange includes that random number. Whether robins should be used in this randomway or the above sequential way, the answer is “it depends”. It seems that moreinstruments use sequential, though. This is how random round robins would beset up for our kick drum samples:&lt;global&gt;loop_mode=one_shot&lt;group&gt;key=36 hivel=31 amp_velcurve_31=1&lt;region&gt;hirand=0.25 sample=kick_vl1_rr1.wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0.25 hirand=0.5 sample=kick_vl1_rr2.wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0.5 hirand=0.75 sample=kick_vl1_rr3.wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0.75 sample=kick_vl1_rr4.wav&lt;group&gt;key=36 lovel=32 hivel=63 amp_velcurve_63=1&lt;region&gt;hirand=0.25 sample=kick_vl2_rr1.wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0.25 hirand=0.5 sample=kick_vl2_rr2.wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0.5 hirand=0.75 sample=kick_vl2_rr3.wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0.75 sample=kick_vl2_rr4.wav&lt;group&gt;key=36 lovel=64 hivel=95 amp_velcurve_95=1&lt;region&gt;hirand=0.25 sample=kick_vl3_rr1.wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0.25 hirand=0.5 sample=kick_vl3_rr2.wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0.5 hirand=0.75 sample=kick_vl3_rr3.wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0.75 sample=kick_vl3_rr4.wav&lt;group&gt;key=36 lovel=96&lt;region&gt;hirand=0.25 sample=kick_vl4_rr1.wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0.25 hirand=0.5 sample=kick_vl4_rr2.wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0.5 hirand=0.75 sample=kick_vl4_rr3.wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0.75 sample=kick_vl4_rr4.wavIf we go back to sequential round robins and add a snare with onlythree round robins, plus a few comments, the resulting SFZ would look like this:// This is an example of a basic drum kit mapping// All samples set to play in their entirety when a note is received&lt;global&gt;loop_mode=one_shot// This is the kick, on MIDI note 36, with four dynamic layers and four round robins&lt;group&gt;key=36 hivel=31 amp_velcurve_31=1 seq_length=4&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=kick_vl1_rr1.wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=kick_vl1_rr2.wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=kick_vl1_rr3.wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=4 sample=kick_vl1_rr4.wav&lt;group&gt;key=36 lovel=32 hivel=63 amp_velcurve_63=1 seq_length=4&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=kick_vl2_rr1.wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=kick_vl2_rr2.wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=kick_vl2_rr3.wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=4 sample=kick_vl2_rr4.wav&lt;group&gt;key=36 lovel=64 hivel=95 amp_velcurve_95=1 seq_length=4&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=kick_vl3_rr1.wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=kick_vl3_rr2.wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=kick_vl3_rr3.wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=4 sample=kick_vl3_rr4.wav&lt;group&gt;key=36 lovel=96 seq_length=4&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=kick_vl4_rr1.wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=kick_vl4_rr2.wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=kick_vl4_rr3.wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=4 sample=kick_vl4_rr4.wav// Here is the snare, on MIDI note 38, with four dynamic layers and three round robins&lt;group&gt;key=38 hivel=31 amp_velcurve_31=1 seq_length=3&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=snare_vl1_rr1.wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=snare_vl1_rr2.wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=snare_vl1_rr3.wav&lt;group&gt;key=38 lovel=32 hivel=63 amp_velcurve_63=1 seq_length=3&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=snare_vl2_rr1.wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=snare_vl2_rr2.wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=snare_vl2_rr3.wav&lt;group&gt;key=38 lovel=64 hivel=95 amp_velcurve_95=1 seq_length=3&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=snare_vl3_rr1.wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=snare_vl3_rr2.wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=snare_vl3_rr3.wav&lt;group&gt;key=38 lovel=96 seq_length=3&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=snare_vl4_rr1.wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=snare_vl4_rr2.wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=snare_vl4_rr3.wavThis is almost all the information needed to map basic drum kits in SFZ.

The defaults are loccN=0 and hiccN=127.Practical applications include using MIDI CC to switch things on and off - forexample, additional voices, release noises, vibrato etc. A common example wouldbe having a hi-hat with various degrees of openness sampled, all of those mappedto the same MIDI note, and hicc/locc used to define the ranges for which eachdegree of openness should play.

The reason for this isthat with default velocity tracking behavior and non-normalized samples (andthere are many reasons why normalizing samples should be avoided), the quietvelocity layers will be too quiet.Examplelovel=64 hivel=95An instrument with four velocity-controlled dynamic layers might use lovel andhivel like this:&lt;region&gt;hivel=31 amp_velcurve_31=1 sample=kick_vl1.wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=32 hivel=63 amp_velcurve_63=1 sample=kick_vl2.wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=64 hivel=95 amp_velcurve_95=1 sample=kick_vl3.wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=96 sample=kick_vl4.wavThe way this would work is the kick_vl1.wav region will play at velocities upto 31, with volume going gradually from 0 at velocity 0 (so, no sound) to fullvolume at velocity 31.

Currently the SFZ 2 opcodes and ARIA extensionsdocumented though some require more detail, and SFZ 2 opcodes not supported byARIA still need to be added. There's enough information to make complex SFZinstruments already, but we'll continue to add more.To make use of the SFZ format requires three things:- Samples- [SFZ player]- [SFZ file]which tells the player how to use the samples. The SFZ file itself can be createdusing any text editor, though for more complex cases with hundreds or thousandsof samples, additional tools can make this easier - some people use spreadsheets,and there are also dedicated [SFZ creation tools].The SFZ format is a file format to define how a collection of samples arearranged for performance. The goal behind the SFZ format is to provide a free,simple, minimalistic and expandable format to arrange, distribute and use audiosamples with the highest possible quality and the highest possible performanceflexibility. Soundware, software and hardware developers can create, use anddistribute the SFZ format files for free, for either free or commercial applications.- Here's a [basic SFZ file] you can copy to start your own- Here is the [list of SFZ headers]- The [list of SFZ 1] can be found here.- You can browse the many SFZ 2 opcodes [starting here].- A few opcodes have been added to [ARIA / Sforzando] for more flexibility- Here the [SFZ test suite] published online on the [Cakewalk forum].### Making InstrumentsText guides on how to make a simple instrument, covering the essential opcodes- [Drum basics] - covers `global`, `group` and  `region` headers, `sample`, `key`, `lovel` / `hivel`, `amp_velcurve_N`,  `seq_length`, `seq_position` and `lorand` / `hirand`.- [Sustained note basics] - using a flute  as an example.

In many cases, though, it makes sense to treat the legato notesdifferently than the notes which start a phrase when no other note is playing. The[trigger](/opcodes/trigger) opcode is used to separate regions into initial and legato. Forsustained sounds, it can make sense to use the [offset](/opcodes/offset) opcode to skip the startof the sample for legato regions. It's also probably a good idea to use offset_attackin these cases, which both makes the transition sound smoother and avoids clicks andpops in cases where the offset does not fall on a zero crossing. Here are the relevantopcodes from the Hadziha choir.An offset of 6000 samples is enough to skip the fraction of a second when the singersare starting the note, but not enough to skip the part of the sample when they're stillsettling on a common pitch, so it works well for this particular choir. The crossfadetimes with an off time of 1 second and legato note attack time of 0.4 seconds areprobably much longer than would be needed for most solo instruments or voices, orensembles intended for fast legato, but could be a good range for other types ofensembles playing slowly.Note that the samples are not all in the same group - the initial note regions are inpolyphony group 1, which is muted by group 2. The legato regions are in polyphonygroup 2, which mutes itself. Having everything in group 1 should also work, though.This was done this was to allow the use of additional syllable start samples, whichwould then be group 3 and also be muted by group 2. As with hi-hat muting, if thereare multiple mic positions in separate files, each mic position will need its ownpolyphony groups.```off_mode=timeoff_time=1amp_veltrack=0trigger=firstgroup=1off_by=2//Sample map goes here#include \"mappings/6_a_map.sfz\"trigger=legatooffset=6000ampeg_attack=0.4group=2off_by=2//Sample map goes here#include \"mappings/6_a_map.sfz\"```As this does not use velocity to control note volume, that frees up velocity forsomething else, so in this specific case velocity is repurposed to shorten theattack time on the legato notes, which makes the patch more intuitively playable.```off_mode=timeoff_time=1amp_veltrack=0trigger=firstgroup=1off_by=3//Sample map goes here#include \"mappings/6_a_map.sfz\"trigger=legatooffset=6000ampeg_attack=1ampeg_vel2attack=-0.8group=3off_by=3//Sample map goes here#include \"mappings/6_a_map.sfz\"```## PortamentoAnother possibility is portamento, or having a pitch glide implemented on thelegato regions. Here are the relevant opcodes from Karoryfer SamplesMeatbass, which has both legato and portamento. The portamento isvery obviously fake for slow glides across long intervals, but as long as theinterval is no more than a third or fourth, it can be convincing. Of course, thenarrower the interval and the shorter the time, the easier it is to soundconvincing. With the portamento time at zero, this is effectively the same asnon-portamento legato in the above example.In the below setup, MIDI CC109 controls the glide time and an SFZ2 [envelope](/types/envelope_generators)is used to make the pitch change happen. CC140 is the ARIA extension CC for pitchdelta, and being the difference in pitch between the previous note and thecurrent note, it sets the depth of the glide envelope.```eg06_sustain=1 //Pitch envelope setup for legato slideseg06_level0=-1 //Envelope starts away from the note pitcheg06_time0=0eg06_pitch_oncc140=100 //This is the pitch deptheg06_time1=0eg06_level1=0 //At the end of the envelope, return to base pitch//eg06_time1_oncc109 needs to be set for the legato regions - but we don't want//it on for all regions so the default is 0//At zero envelope duration the pitch goes to base pitch immediately so there//is no glide//Typical stuff for monophonic instrumentsoff_mode=normalampeg_release_oncc104=2```All the sample regions are then basically duplicated in non-legato and legatoversions. Here's an example non-legato region with triggerset to first and no eg06_time_oncc109 set. The group and off_by work just likein the above examples.```trigger=firstoff_mode=normalgroup=1off_by=1sample=..\\Samples\\arco_looped\\c4_sustain.wavpitch_keycenter=48```And the corresponding legato region with trigger set to legato, the eg06 glideenvelope time control, and also an attack time, to let the note fade inmore gradually, with this controlled by CC100 rather than velocity, as theexample above.

The trigger=first regionswork similarly as all the above examples, and the [sw_down](/opcodes/sw_down) opcode can be usedto choose which sample plays for the legato regions. If the samples would includeboth the legato transition and the complete sustain of the following note, thingswould be very simple:```// Legato transitions and the complete sustain of the next note both in the same sampletrigger=legatogroup=2off_by=1ampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_release=0.2off_mode=normal// Leg transitions up sample=legatovib_g4_a4.wav key=A4 sw_down=G4 sample=legatovib_g4_c5.wav key=C5 sw_down=G4 sample=legatovib_a4_c5.wav key=C5 sw_down=A4// Leg transitions down sample=legatovib_c5_a4.wav key=A4 sw_down=C5 sample=legatovib_c5_g4.wav key=G4 sw_down=C5```Recording the full sustain after every transition adds greatly to the recordingtime, diskspace and RAM use, however. It may be necessary in some cases, such assolo vocals, but in other cases it's possible to use transition samples whichare short, then fade in the regular sustain sample.```// Legato transitions in one sample, crossfaded into standard sustain in another sampletrigger=legatogroup=2off_by=1ampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_release=0.2off_mode=normal// Leg transitions up sample=legatovib_g4_a4.wav key=A4 sw_down=G4 ampeg_hold=0.25 ampeg_decay=0.2 ampeg_sustain=0 offset=45000 ampeg_decay_shape=-1.4 sample=legatovib_g4_c5.wav key=C5 sw_down=G4 ampeg_hold=0.25 ampeg_decay=0.2 ampeg_sustain=0 offset=45000 ampeg_decay_shape=-1.4 sample=legatovib_a4_c5.wav key=C5 sw_down=A4 ampeg_hold=0.25 ampeg_decay=0.2 ampeg_sustain=0 offset=45000 ampeg_decay_shape=-1.4// Leg transitions down sample=legatovib_c5_a4.wav key=A4 sw_down=C5 ampeg_hold=0.25 ampeg_decay=0.2 ampeg_sustain=0 offset=45000 ampeg_decay_shape=-1.4 sample=legatovib_c5_g4.wav key=G4 sw_down=C5 ampeg_hold=0.25 ampeg_decay=0.2 ampeg_sustain=0 offset=45000 ampeg_decay_shape=-1.4 sample=legatovib_a4_g4.wav key=G4 sw_down=A4 ampeg_hold=0.25 ampeg_decay=0.2 ampeg_sustain=0 offset=43000 ampeg_decay_shape=-1.4// Leg sustains sample=sustainvib_c5.wav key=C5 ampeg_attack=0.3 offset=5000 ampeg_attack_shape=3.8 sample=sustainvib_a4.wav key=A4 ampeg_attack=0.3 offset=5000 ampeg_attack_shape=3.8 sample=sustainvib_g4.wav key=G4 ampeg_attack=0.3 offset=5000 ampeg_attack_shape=3.8```Another consideration is that for instruments with a wide range, it may not be worthwhileto record every possible transition, and only record transitions of up to one octave, forexample. Defaulting to simple crossfade is an option here. This is left as an exercise tothe reader.",

They are used to create effects such as pitch vibrato(when modulating pitch), tremolo (when modulating volume) and filter wobble(when modulating filter cutoff)LFOs are triggered by note-on events for the specified region, which means thereare no free-running LFOs in the SFZ spec. If a free-running LFO is needed, forexample to apply one slow pitch vibrato wave to a series of rapidly plucked oudnotes, that will need to use an external modulation source outside theSFZ player - in other words, perhaps in a DAW that the SFZ player is being usedin as a plugin.#### SFZ 1 LFOs3 LFO destinations in SFZ 1 standard:- amplfo (amplitude)- fillfo (filter)- pitchlfo (pitch)[Here's a very simple example of a pitch LFO integration](/tutorials/lfo)- [(lfo type)_delay](/opcodes/amplfo_delay)- [(lfo type)_fade](/opcodes/amplfo_fade)- [(lfo type)_freq](/opcodes/amplfo_freq)- [(lfo type)_freqccX](/opcodes/amplfo_freq)- [(lfo type)_depth](/opcodes/amplfo_depth)- [(lfo type)_depthccX](/opcodes/amplfo_depth)- [(lfo type)_depthchanaft](/opcodes/amplfo_depthchanaft)- [(lfo type)_depthpolyaft](/opcodes/amplfo_depthpolyaft)- [(lfo type)_freqchanaft](/opcodes/amplfo_freqchanaft)- [(lfo type)_freqpolyaft](/opcodes/amplfo_freqpolyaft)#### Assignable LFOs (SFZ 2)Much like the Flex EG, these newer LFO can target almost any tone-defining parameter:[Here's a very simple example of an sfz 2 lfo integration, targeted to pitch](/tutorials/lfo)- [lfoN_wave](/opcodes/lfoN_wave)- [lfoN_freq](/opcodes/lfoN_freq)- [lfoN_freq_onccX](/opcodes/lfoN_freq)- [lfoN_freq_smoothccX](/opcodes/lfoN_freq_smoothccX)- [lfoN_freq_stepccX](/opcodes/lfoN_freq_stepccX)- [lfoN_delay](/opcodes/lfoN_delay)- [lfoN_delay_onccX](/opcodes/lfoN_delay)- [lfoN_fade](/opcodes/lfoN_fade)- [lfoN_fade_onccX](/opcodes/lfoN_fade)- [lfoN_phase](/opcodes/lfoN_phase)- [lfoN_phase_onccX](/opcodes/lfoN_phase)- [lfoN_count](/opcodes/lfoN_count)#### Assignable LFO DestinationsThese destinations are added as a suffix to 'lfoN_'.

Note that`hirand` for a region should equal `lorand` for the next region - if we had, forexample, `hirand`=0.249 for the first region and `lorand`=0.25 for the next,that would result in no sound playing if the random number generated was, forexample, 0.2496343491.

This results in randomization,but prevents the possibility of the same sample being triggered twice in a rowwhen the random number generated falls into the same range as the previouslygenerated number. This can be good when there are a lot (6 or more) round robinsamples available. The code for 8 samples split into two sequential subsets mightlook like this:``` seq_length=2 seq_position=1 hirand=0.25 sample=kick_vl1_rr1.wav seq_length=2 seq_position=1 lorand=0.25 hirand=0.5 sample=kick_vl1_rr2.wav seq_length=2 seq_position=1 lorand=0.5 hirand=0.75 sample=kick_vl1_rr3.wav seq_length=2 seq_position=1 lorand=0.75 sample=kick_vl1_rr4.wav seq_length=2 seq_position=2 hirand=0.25 sample=kick_vl1_rr5.wav seq_length=2 seq_position=2 lorand=0.25 hirand=0.5 sample=kick_vl1_rr6.wav seq_length=2 seq_position=2 lorand=0.5 hirand=0.75 sample=kick_vl1_rr7.wav seq_length=2 seq_position=2 lorand=0.75 sample=kick_vl1_rr8.wav```There are other potential uses which have nothing to do with round robins, forexample having key fingering noises on a clarinet trigger sometimes(but not always) when a note is played.",

It is also possible to use `lovel` / `hivel`to control other things instead, such as articulations - for example, a guitarcould have palm-muted samples on low velocities, and pinch harmonics on velocity 127.These opcodes will often need to be used with [amp_velcurve_N](/opcodes/amp_velcurve_N),unless [amp_veltrack](/opcodes/amp_veltrack) is set to 0. The reason for this isthat with default velocity tracking behavior and non-normalized samples (andthere are many reasons why normalizing samples should be avoided), the quietvelocity layers will be too quiet.## Example```lovel=64 hivel=95```An instrument with four velocity-controlled dynamic layers might use `lovel` and`hivel` like this:```hivel=31 amp_velcurve_31=1 sample=kick_vl1.wavlovel=32 hivel=63 amp_velcurve_63=1 sample=kick_vl2.wavlovel=64 hivel=95 amp_velcurve_95=1 sample=kick_vl3.wavlovel=96 sample=kick_vl4.wav```The way this would work is the kick_vl1.wav region will play at velocities upto 31, with volume going gradually from 0 at velocity 0 (so, no sound) to fullvolume at velocity 31. The kick_vl2.wav region will play at velocties 32 to 63,with volume being full at velocity 63 and lower volume (but not zero) at 32.The kick_vl3 wav region will play at velocites 64 to 95, with full volume atvelocity 95. Finally, the kick_vl4 layer plays at velocities 96 to 127, with no`amp_velcurve_N` set meaning it will have full volume at velocity 127.",

		"content": "The set of modulations available under the SFZ1 specification is fixed, andthere's a dedicated opcode for every possible modulation, including fairlyesoteric ones such as using note velocity to modulate the hold stage of thepitch envelope.## Basic MIDI CC modulationA few opcodes can be modulated simply by MIDI CC, with the modulation addingto what the opcode would normally do. These are: [offset](/opcodes/offset) and [delay](/opcodes/delay).For example, this would have a sample offset of 500 when the modulating CC isat 0, and a sample offset of 1000 when the modulating CC is at max:```offset=500offset_cc100=500```It's also possible to just specify the modulation, in which case thedefault value is what will be modulated. The defaults for offset, delay andEQ band gain are 0, so this would result in the offset being modulated between0 and 1000:```offset_cc100=1000```## Modulating default valuesThe three EQ bands' [frequency](/opcodes/eqN_freq), [bandwidth](/opcodes/eqN_bw) and[gain](/opcodes/eqN_gain) work similarly, but also add velocity tracking. The EQbandwidth and center frequency also have non-zero defaults,for example eq2_freq is 500 if not specified. So, this would modulate the centerfrequency of the second EQ band between 500 and 1500 if eq2_freq is left at default:```eq2_freqcc110=1000```## Velocity tracking, keytracking and randomizationEQ [frequency](/opcodes/eqN_vel2freq) and [gain](/opcodes/eqN_vel2gain) (but notbandwidth) can additionally be modulated by velocity. For example, if we want tomake a sound brighter when the velocity is higher, we might use something like this:```eq1_vel2gain=-6eq2_vel2gain=12eq2_vel2freq=500```The [xfin](/opcodes/xfin_loccN)/[xfout](/opcodes/xfout_loccN) CCs are also away to fade sounds in and out using MIDI CC. An example of one note with twodynamic layers being crossfaded:```sample=e4_ft_p.wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=63 xfout_locc1=64 xfout_hicc1=127sample=e4_ft_f.wav xfin_locc1=64 xfin_hicc1=127```In addition to MIDI CC, crossfades can also use MIDI note number and velocity asmodulation sources, and the [xf_cccurve](/opcodes/xf_cccurve), [xf_keycurve](/opcodes/xf_keycurve)and [xf_velcurve](/opcodes/xf_velcurve) give the choice of two curves for each of these modulations.More sophisticated modulations are possible with volume,pitch and [filter cutoff](/opcodes/cutoff). Volume and cutoff can be modulated by MIDI CC directly(pitch can't in SFZ1 - the tune_ccN modulation is an ARIA extension). All threecan also have randomization applied and be modulated by MIDI note number andvelocity. The nomenclature for volume is a little confusing, with [gain_ccN](/opcodes/volume) using\"gain\" in the name, while the others are called [amp_random](/opcodes/amp_random),[amp_keytrack](/opcodes/amp_keytrack) and [amp_veltrack](/opcodes/amp_veltrack).```gain_cc80=-6amp_random=3amp_keytrack=-1.3amp_veltrack=80```## LFOs and envelopesVolume, filter and cutoff also each get an [LFO](/types/lfo#sfz-1-lfos) and an[envelope](/types/envelope_generators#sfz-1-egs). The LFO rate anddepth can be modulated by MIDI CC. Each LFO also has a simple envelope withdelay and fade, but modulating the duration of these is not allowed under theSFZ1 spec (though it is with SFZ2 LFOs). Here's a typical pitch vibrato LFO:```pitchlfo_freq=2pitchlfo_freqcc50=10pitchlfo_depthcc51=33```Each envelope parameter can also be modulated by CC, or by velocity. Here's aexmple setup for a synth-style ADSR volume envelope (hold is not specified so thedefault hold value of 0 is used) controlled by CCs and some initialminimum values set for attack and release, along with a default sustain of 0:```ampeg_attack=0.001ampeg_attack_oncc40=1ampeg_decay_oncc41=4ampeg_sustain=1ampeg_sustain_oncc42=100ampeg_release=0.1ampeg_release_oncc43=0.9```Modulating envelope parameters with velocity allows, for example, setting up a filteron an acid bass which will sweep farther with higher velocity, and also sweep faster.```cutoff=120resonance=12fileg_attack=0.5fileg_decay=1fileg_depth=500fileg_vel2attack=-0.4fileg_vel2decay=-0.8fileg_vel2depth=4000```If something is not described above, then modulating it is not possible under theSFZ1 specification, and will require [using SFZ2](/tutorials/sfz2_modulations)or possibly some extension opcodes.",

		"content": "The modulations available under SFZ2 are much more flexible than the fixed set[specified by SFZ1](/tutorials/sfz1_modulations). All SFZ1 modulations are stillavailable under the SFZ2 spec, and will often be easier to use in cases such asenvelopes where the standard AHDSR shape is all that's needed.The basic difference is that SFZ1 has three envelopes - one assigned to volume, one to pitch, and one to filter cutoff. There are also three LFOs,one for each of those modulation targets. SFZ2 can have an arbitraty numberof envelopes and LFOs, with the ability to specify one or more modulationtargets from a list. It is even possible for LFOs to modulate other LFOsand envelopes to modulate LFOs (but not for LFOs to modulate envelopes).In addition, SFZ2 envelopes can have an arbitrary number of points.## Additional MIDI CC modulationSFZ2 adds one more paramter which can be modulated with MIDI CC - [stereo width](/opcodes/width_onccN).Also need to document pan_onccX and find out whether it's SFZ1 or SFZ2 - currentlynot sure, needs testing.## LFOsFor each LFO, an LFO number must be specified - lfo01, lfo02 etc. EachLFO has the following parameters:- [lfoN_wave](/opcodes/lfoN_wave)- [lfoN_freq](/opcodes/lfoN_freq)- [lfoN_freq_onccX](/opcodes/lfoN_freq)- [lfoN_freq_smoothccX](/opcodes/lfoN_freq_smoothccX)- [lfoN_freq_stepccX](/opcodes/lfoN_freq_stepccX)- [lfoN_delay](/opcodes/lfoN_delay)- [lfoN_delay_onccX](/opcodes/lfoN_delay)- [lfoN_fade](/opcodes/lfoN_fade)- [lfoN_fade_onccX](/opcodes/lfoN_fade)- [lfoN_phase](/opcodes/lfoN_phase)- [lfoN_phase_onccX](/opcodes/lfoN_phase)- [lfoN_count](/opcodes/lfoN_count)Click on each link for a detailed description. Similarly to SFZ1 LFOs,there's a frequency, a delay and a fade-in time. In addition, thewaveform shape and initial phase can be specified and the LFO canbe configured to run for a limited number of counts.The frequency, delay, fade and initial phase can all be modulated byMIDI CC. There is no modulation for LFO depth - to control the depthof vibrato etc, use MIDI CC to modulate how much the LFO affects thedesired target.## Available LFO targetsThe available modulation targets for LFOs are These destinations areadded as a suffix to 'lfoN_'. For example```lfo01_pitch=100```makes LFO 01 affect pitch with a max depth of 100 cents.```lfo03_freq_lfo01_oncc117=1.3```would make LFO 03 add up to 1.3 Hertz tothe frequency of LFO 01, with the amount modulated by MIDI CC 117.The avaialble targets related to volume and stereo positioning are:- volume- volume_oncc- volume_smoothcc- volume_stepcc- amplitude- amplitude_oncc- amplitude_smoothcc- amplitude_stepcc- pan- pan_oncc- pan_smoothcc- pan_stepcc- width- width_oncc- width_smoothcc- width_stepcc The targets for pitch modulation are:- pitch- pitch_oncc- pitch_smoothcc- pitch_stepccThe targets for filter modulation are cutoff and resonance, for boththe first and second filter:- cutoff- cutoff_oncc- cutoff_smoothcc- cutoff_stepcc- resonance- resonance_oncc- resonance_smoothcc- resonance_stepcc- cutoff2- cutoff2_oncc- cutoff2_smoothcc- cutoff2_stepcc- resonance2- resonance2_oncc- resonance2_smoothcc- resonance2_stepccThe modulations of the EQ bands are:- eqNfreq- eqNfreq_oncc- eqNfreq_smoothcc- eqNfreq_stepcc- eqNbw- eqNbw_oncc- eq1bw_smoothcc- eqNbw_stepcc- eqNgain- eqNgain_oncc- eqNgain_smoothcc- eqNgain_stepccThe following targets affect other LFOs:- freq_lfoX- depth_lfoX- depthadd_lfoXSome Cakewalk instruments can also modulate the decim and bitred effects:- decim- decim_oncc- decim_smoothcc- decim_stepcc- bitred- bitred_oncc- bitred_smoothcc- bitred_stepcc## LFO examplesHere is an example of how one LFO could be used to control both pitch vibratoand volume vibrato (tremolo) with the rate, pitch vibrato depth, tremolodepth, delay and fade each controlled by a separate MIDI CC parameter:```lfo01_pitch_oncc111=22 // Vibrato LFOlfo01_freq=2lfo01_freq_oncc113=7lfo01_delay_oncc114=0.500lfo01_fade_oncc115=0.500lfo01_volume=0 // This LFO also does tremololfo01_volume_oncc112=2```And an LFO which does just pitch vibrato, and has a second LFO modulating itsrate to create some unsteadiness:```lfo01_pitch_oncc111=22 // Vibrato LFOlfo01_freq=2lfo01_freq_oncc113=7lfo01_delay_oncc114=0.500lfo01_fade_oncc115=0.500lfo2_freq_lfo1_oncc116=3   //Affect the rate of the other LFO for unsteady vibratolfo02_wave=1lfo02_freq=0.1lfo02_freq_oncc116=0.9```For randomized humanization, the extended MIDI CC 135 can be used to randomize theinitial phase and speed of the second LFO.```lfo01_pitch_oncc111=22 // Vibrato LFOlfo01_freq=2lfo01_freq_oncc113=7lfo01_delay_oncc114=0.500lfo01_fade_oncc115=0.500lfo2_freq_lfo1_oncc116=3   //Affect the rate of the other LFO for unsteady vibratolfo02_wave=1lfo02_freq=0.1lfo02_freq_oncc116=0.8lfo02_phase_oncc135=1lfo02_freq_oncc135=0.2```## EnvelopesSFZ2 envelopes are numbered and can have an arbitrary number of points, withthe level at each point and its modulation set separately. The opcodes usedto create these envelopes are:- [egN_points](/opcodes/egN_points)- [egN_levelX](/opcodes/egN_levelX)- [egN_levelX_onccY](/opcodes/egN_levelX)- [egN_timeX](/opcodes/egN_timeX)- [egN_timeX_onccY](/opcodes/egN_timeX)- [egN_shapeX](/opcodes/egN_shapeX)- [egN_curveX](/opcodes/egN_curveX)- [egN_sustain](/opcodes/egN_sustain)- [egN_loop](/opcodes/egN_loop)## Envelope targetsSimilarly to LFOs, envelopes have assignable modulation targets. Thesedestinations are added as a suffix to ‘egN_’  - so, for example:```eg01_pitch=2400```would have envelope 01 modulate pitch, with an envelope depth of 2400 cents.These are the available targets related to amplitude and stereo positioning:- amplitude- amplitude_oncc- volume- volume_oncc- pan- pan_oncc- width- width_onccTargets for pitch:- pitch- pitch_onccTargets for filters:- cutoff- cutoff_oncc- resonance- resonance_oncc- cutoff2- cutoff2_oncc- resonance2- resonance2_onccTargets for EQ bands:- eqNbw- eqNbw_oncc- eqNfreq- eqNfreq_oncc- eqNgain- eqNgain_onccTargets for modulating LFOs:- depth_lfo - depthadd_lfo- freq_lfoThese two need to be tested - are they for envelopes to modulate other envelopes?- depth- depth_onccTargets for modulating decim and bitred do not appear to have been included in the specification.## Example envelopeHere is a simple pitch envelope which will start a note with a glide from up to an octavelower, with the depth and time modulated by MIDI CCs. The envelope will statt at a lowervalue at envelope point 0, and return the pitch to normal at envelope point 1.```eg01_sustain=1 //Pitch envelope setup for slideseg01_level0=1eg01_level1=0eg01_time0=0eg01_time1=0eg01_pitch_oncc100=-1200eg01_time1_oncc101=1```## Using LFOs and evelopes togehterHere is an example of using both an envelope and an LFO to modulate pitch, with commondepth and delay parameters. The goal here is asymmetrical pitch vibrato - vibrato whichdoes not go up and down around the original pitch, but instead only goes below it. Thisis idiomatic with saxophones, and is also how vibrato with certain types of non-floatingguitar bridges works (string-bending vibrato is similar, of course, but in the otherdirection).Shifting the phase of LFO01 will make the vibrato waveform start at the top. We also needto lower the pitch by the same amount as the vibrato depth. Using an envelope for thisallows us to delay the onset of the vibrato (again, an important element of idiomaticsaxophone vibrato) without a discontinuous jump in pitch. ```lfo01_pitch_oncc111=20 //Saxy vibrato LFO - goes down from the main pitchlfo01_freq=2lfo01_freq_oncc112=8lfo01_phase=0.25 //To make it start at the toplfo01_delay_oncc116=1eg01_pitch_oncc111=20eg01_sustain=1eg01_level0=0eg01_level1=0eg01_level2=-1eg01_time0=0eg01_time1=0eg01_time1_oncc116=1eg01_time2=0```## Using SFZ1 and SFZ2 modulations togetherBoth SFZ1 and SFZ2 modulations may be mixed freely. Indeed, it may be simpler to accomplishthe above using the SFZ1 pitch envelope, as it is sufficient in this case, with the SFZ2LFO. Setting the initial phase and modulating the delay with MIDI CC would not be possiblewith the SFZ1 pitch LFO.```lfo01_pitch_oncc111=20 //Saxy vibrato LFO - goes down from the main pitchlfo01_freq=2lfo01_freq_oncc112=8lfo01_phase=0.25 //To make it start at the toplfo01_delay_oncc116=1pitcheg_delay_oncc116=1 //Pitch envelope to drop the central pitch when sax vibrato kicks inpitcheg_depth_oncc111=-20```## SmoothccN and stepccNMost MIDI CC modulations, though not all, can have use [smoothccN](/modulations/smoothccN) and [stepccN](/modulations/stepccN).These work similarly to [bend_smooth](/opcodes/bend_smooth) and [bend_step](/opcodes/bend_step).SmoothccN adds \"interia\" to a modulation, so quickly changing the MIDI CC value has a slower effecton the modulation target than it would normally. StepccN causes the modulation to happen in adiscrete number of steps. Setting the number of steps to 1 would make the modulation anall-or-nothing control.This is what's possible under the SFZ2 specification. There are some additional modulationsavailable as [ARIA extensions](/extensions/aria/), with [amplitude_onccN](/opcodes/amplitude)being a very useful one.",

		"content": "We've covered the basic opcodes required to map simple drum instruments on[another page](/tutorials/drum_basics), and here we are going to apply thatknowledge to pitched instruments, plus add more opcodes. Let's say we want tosample a folk flute whose lowest note is a D. If the lowest five notes areD, E, F#, G and A, and there is one sample available for each note, they couldbe mapped like this:```key=50 sample=d4.wavkey=52 sample=e4.wavkey=54 sample=f#4.wavkey=55 sample=g4.wavkey=57 sample=a4.wav```This would work well enough to make a sound when a MIDI note corresponding toone of the sampled pitches is played. However, playing notes inbetweenthe D and E, or E and F#, would mean no sound. We can \"stretch\" one of theneighboring notes to cover that D# and that F using the[lokey, hikey](/opcodes/lokey) and [pitch_keycenter](/opcodes/pitch_keycenter) opcodes instead of key.If a sample does not need to cover multiple notes, it can still use key. Whetherto use the D or E sample to cover the D# in our example is a judgment call -which sounds better?```lokey=50 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=50 sample=d4.wavlokey=52 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=52 sample=e4.wavkey=54 sample=f#4.wavlokey=55 hikey=55 pitch_keycenter=56 sample=g4.wavkey=57 sample=a4.wav```The samples will play as long as a note is held, but when the note is released,they will end suddenly, which is probably not realistic for a flute sound, orindeed most other instruments. We'll need to apply a volume envelope with arelease time set, which can be applied to all regions.The [ampeg_release](/opcodes/ampeg_release) opcode accomplishes this.```ampeg_release=0.3lokey=50 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=50 sample=d4.wavlokey=52 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=52 sample=e4.wavkey=54 sample=f#4.wavkey=55 sample=g4.wav```If we have samples at various dynamics, such as quiet and loud, we could usenote velocity to choose which sample is played - however, while this makesperfect sense for drum hits or piano notes, with instruments such as flute orviolin, it's possible for the player to vary the dynamic level while a note isbeing sustained. This can be simulated with the[xfin_loccN/xfin_hiccN](/opcodes/xfin_loccN) and[xfout_loccN/xfout_hiccN](/opcodes/xfout_loccN) opcodes. Using only theD4 and E4 samples as an example, and controlling the dynamics with CC1 (mod wheel).The [amp_veltrack](/opcodes/amp_veltrack) opcode is set to 0,so that velocity does not affect volume.```ampeg_release=0.3 amp_veltrack=0lokey=50 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=50 sample=d4_p.wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=42 xfout_locc1=43 xfout_hicc1=85sample=d4_mf.wav xfin_locc1=43 xfin_hicc1=85 xfout_locc1=86 xfout_hicc1=127sample=d4_f.wav xfin_locc1=86 xfin_hicc1=127lokey=52 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=52 sample=e4_p.wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=42 xfout_locc1=43 xfout_hicc1=85sample=e4_mf.wav xfin_locc1=43 xfin_hicc1=85 xfout_locc1=86 xfout_hicc1=127sample=e4_f.wav xfin_locc1=86 xfin_hicc1=127```Now, CC1 would first fade in the quiet sample when it was between 0 and 42.From 43 to 85, the quiet sample is faded out and the medium sample faded in.From 86 to the max value of 127, the medium sample is faded out while the loud sample fades in. If we have multiple techniques or articulation sampled, forexample regular sustains and fluttertongue sustains, we need a way to switchbetween them. Each could be its own independent and complete SFZ file, and wecould just load the desired file into the player, but for convenience,especially in live performance, it's good to load both at once and have a way ofswitching between them. One way is [loccN/hiccN](/opcodes/loccN)where which sample is triggered for a particular note depends on the value ofa MIDI CC - let's use MIDI CC 11.Notice that the fluttertongue samples in this example have fewer dynamic layersthan the main sustain samples - it's common for the \"core\" articulations of aninstrument to be sampled in more detail, and the SFZ format is flexible enoughto allow this, or even allow different amounts of dynamic layers or round robinsfor different notes within the same articulation.```ampeg_release=0.3 amp_veltrack=0lokey=50 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=50 hicc11=63sample=d4_p.wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=42 xfout_locc1=43 xfout_hicc1=85sample=d4_mf.wav xfin_locc1=43 xfin_hicc1=85 xfout_locc1=86 xfout_hicc1=127sample=d4_f.wav xfin_locc1=86 xfin_hicc1=127lokey=52 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=52 hicc11=63sample=e4_p.wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=42 xfout_locc1=43 xfout_hicc1=85sample=e4_mf.wav xfin_locc1=43 xfin_hicc1=85 xfout_locc1=86 xfout_hicc1=127sample=e4_f.wav xfin_locc1=86 xfin_hicc1=127lokey=50 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=50 locc11=64sample=d4_ft_p.wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=63 xfout_locc1=64 xfout_hicc1=127sample=d4_ft_f.wav xfin_locc1=64 xfin_hicc1=127lokey=52 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=52 locc11=64sample=e4_ft_p.wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=63 xfout_locc1=64 xfout_hicc1=127sample=e4_ft_f.wav xfin_locc1=64 xfin_hicc1=127```Another, probably more common, way is to use keyswitches. If we define thekeyswitch range as the C and C# below our lowest D using[sw_lokey/sw_hikey](/opcodes/sw_lokey), we can then use[sw_last](/opcodes/sw_last) to select articulations.```ampeg_release=0.3 amp_veltrack=0 sw_lokey=48 sw_hikey=49lokey=50 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=50 sw_last=48sample=d4_p.wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=42 xfout_locc1=43 xfout_hicc1=85sample=d4_mf.wav xfin_locc1=43 xfin_hicc1=85 xfout_locc1=86 xfout_hicc1=127sample=d4_f.wav xfin_locc1=86 xfin_hicc1=127lokey=52 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=52 sw_last=48sample=e4_p.wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=42 xfout_locc1=43 xfout_hicc1=85sample=e4_mf.wav xfin_locc1=43 xfin_hicc1=85 xfout_locc1=86 xfout_hicc1=127sample=e4_f.wav xfin_locc1=86 xfin_hicc1=127lokey=50 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=50 sw_last=49sample=d4_ft_p.wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=63 xfout_locc1=64 xfout_hicc1=127sample=d4_ft_f.wav xfin_locc1=64 xfin_hicc1=127lokey=52 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=52 sw_last=49sample=e4_ft_p.wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=63 xfout_locc1=64 xfout_hicc1=127sample=e4_ft_f.wav xfin_locc1=64 xfin_hicc1=127```There are other possibilities - for example, since velocity is not needed tocontrol dynamics, we could use that to select articulations using[lovel/hivel](/opcodes/lovel), for example. However, it' is quite common,especially with string instruments, to use a MIDI CC to control the dynamics ofsustained articulations, and velocity to control the dynamics of shortarticulations such as staccato. In those cases, the short articulations coulduse amp_veltrack set to 100 instead of 0, and generally be mapped in the sameway as [the drums we've discussed before](/tutorials/drum_basics). The flute isa monophonic instrument in reality - you can't play chords on it, while you canusing our SFZ here. For more realism, playing a note on this flute should muteany previously playing notes. To make an instrument which can only play one noteat a time, the [group](/opcodes/group) and [off_by](/opcodes/off_by)opcodes can be used. Although these can be used in more complex scenarios, for amonophonic instrument with no multiple microphone positions sampled, it's enoughto put all samples in the same group, and have that group muted whenever a newnote from that group is played.```ampeg_release=0.3 amp_veltrack=0 sw_lokey=48 sw_hikey=49 group=1 off_by=1lokey=50 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=50 sw_last=48sample=d4_p.wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=42 xfout_locc1=43 xfout_hicc1=85sample=d4_mf.wav xfin_locc1=43 xfin_hicc1=85 xfout_locc1=86 xfout_hicc1=127sample=d4_f.wav xfin_locc1=86 xfin_hicc1=127lokey=52 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=52 sw_last=48sample=e4_p.wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=42 xfout_locc1=43 xfout_hicc1=85sample=e4_mf.wav xfin_locc1=43 xfin_hicc1=85 xfout_locc1=86 xfout_hicc1=127sample=e4_f.wav xfin_locc1=86 xfin_hicc1=127lokey=50 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=50 sw_last=49sample=d4_ft_p.wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=63 xfout_locc1=64 xfout_hicc1=127sample=d4_ft_f.wav xfin_locc1=64 xfin_hicc1=127lokey=52 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=52 sw_last=49sample=e4_ft_p.wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=63 xfout_locc1=64 xfout_hicc1=127sample=e4_ft_f.wav xfin_locc1=64 xfin_hicc1=127```However, this cuts off the note suddenly, creating a gap before the next notecan reach full volume. That problem can be fixed by setting [off_mode](/opcodes/off_mode)to normal, which will make the notes being muted fade out gradually over theduration previously specified with the ampeg_release opcode.```ampeg_release=0.3 amp_veltrack=0 sw_lokey=48 sw_hikey=49group=1 off_by=1 off_mode=normallokey=50 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=50 sw_last=48sample=d4_p.wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=42 xfout_locc1=43 xfout_hicc1=85sample=d4_mf.wav xfin_locc1=43 xfin_hicc1=85 xfout_locc1=86 xfout_hicc1=127sample=d4_f.wav xfin_locc1=86 xfin_hicc1=127lokey=52 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=52 sw_last=48sample=e4_p.wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=42 xfout_locc1=43 xfout_hicc1=85sample=e4_mf.wav xfin_locc1=43 xfin_hicc1=85 xfout_locc1=86 xfout_hicc1=127sample=e4_f.wav xfin_locc1=86 xfin_hicc1=127lokey=50 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=50 sw_last=49sample=d4_ft_p.wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=63 xfout_locc1=64 xfout_hicc1=127sample=d4_ft_f.wav xfin_locc1=64 xfin_hicc1=127lokey=52 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=52 sw_last=49sample=e4_ft_p.wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=63 xfout_locc1=64 xfout_hicc1=127sample=e4_ft_f.wav xfin_locc1=64 xfin_hicc1=127```This is enough to make a basic monophonic wind instrument, vocal, or othermonophonic instrument. There are more possibilities - better legato, vibratoemulation, multiple microphone positions etc. - which we'll describe later inanother part of this guide. Together with the information covered in [drum basics](/tutorials/drum_basics)earlier, this should also be enough to make a basic sampled piano or guitar.",

		"title": "Vibrato",
		"content": "Emulating vibrato for solo instruments or voices with LFOs is not difficult. The challengesare understanding the key aspects of vibrato on the real instrument, and keeping the number ofparameters from growing too large to be easy to use. The examples here use SFZ 2 spec [numberedLFOs](/types/lfo.html), rather than the [dedicated pitch, volume and filter LFOs](/opcodes/amplfo_depth)and envelopes of SFZ 1. A lot of this can be done under the SFZ 1 specification as well, butthere are some limitations.The most basic, typical vibrato is pitch vibrato - just an LFO modulating pitch. Making theminimum and maximum rates and depths that would be used by players in real life is important,of course. The numbers here are examples which would be decent for bowed strings - it has arate of 2-10 Hz and a maximum depth of 35 cents. Wider and slower are certainly possibleon real instruments, but isn't commonly used in performance.```lfo01_pitch_oncc111=35lfo01_freq=2lfo01_freq_oncc112=8```In real life, however, players and singers will often start a note without vibrato,and add vibrato a fraction of a second later. This is where modulating the [LFO delay parameter](/opcodes/lfoN_delay)becomes useful, and possibly [LFO fade](/opcodes/lfoN_fade) as well. Delay seems like enough for most windinstruments and vocals, but having both delay and fade seems effective with bowed strings.```lfo01_pitch_oncc111=35lfo01_freq=2lfo01_freq_oncc112=8lfo01_delay_oncc115=0.500lfo01_fade_oncc116=0.500```Vibrato on many instruments doesn't just affect pitch; on bowed strings, it seems to havea subtle effect on volume and timbre as well. We can have the same MIDI CC parameter controlhow much the vibrato LFO affects pitch, volume, and an EQ band, with the latter two beingquite subtle.This is a good a time as any to note that not all vibrato is equal - it's not reallypractical to add vibrato to the lowest note playable on a cello, for example, or to anatural harmonic. With pizzicato, vibrato is possible, but probably should not affect theEQ band, and either only affect pitch or pitch plus a subtle effect on volume. The belowwill work reasonably for most bowed notes, however.```lfo01_pitch_oncc111=35lfo01_volume_oncc111=1lfo01_freq=2lfo01_freq_oncc112=8lfo01_delay_oncc115=0.500lfo01_fade_oncc116=0.500eq1_freq=2000eq1_bw=2lfo01_eq1gain_oncc111=2lfo01_eq1freq_oncc111=500```Vibrato can also be humanized, by varying the rate of the vibrato LFO. This can be doneby modulating the rate of the vibrato LFO with another LFO. The ARIA sample & hold[waveform](/opcodes/lfoN_wave.html) can be used here, and the modulation depth controlled by MIDI CC, so when that'sat zero, no humanization happens.```lfo02_freq=1lfo02_wave=12 //Sample & hold LFO waveform numberlfo02_freq_lfo01_oncc117=1```Or, to stay in the SFZ 2 spec and not use ARIA extensions, a sine wave with randomized[starting phase](/opcodes/lfoN_phase) will also work:```lfo02_freq=1lfo02_phase_oncc135=1lfo02_freq_lfo01_oncc117=1```However, when playing multiple layers, such as sustain samples with crossfaded dynamicsor multiple mic positions, this can cause each layer's vibrato to drift out of sync andsound like separate instruments. This is generally not desirable, so it is possible topseudo-randomize the starting phase using a non-random [CC, such as velocity](/extensions/midi_ccs.html)(which is often otherwise unused in sustain sounds with crossfaded dynamics). If the SFZplayer can have a global sample and hold LFO which does not retrigger for each note, thiswould also be a solution, though ARIA does not allow this.```lfo02_freq=1lfo02_phase_oncc132=0.7lfo02_freq_lfo01_oncc117=1```For additional complexity, it's also possible to have the random LFO itself modulate pitch,which will create some pitch drift, and have more than two LFOs involved. Here is a fairlysophisticated example.```//Vibratolfo01_pitch_oncc21=29 //Vibrato LFOlfo01_freq=2 //Any slower than this sounds really lousylfo01_freq_oncc112=6 //8 Hz is about as fast as vibrato on cello can golfo01_delay_oncc115=0.500lfo01_fade_oncc116=0.500//This LFO also does tremololfo01_volume_oncc21=1 //Not much - just a subtle effect on volumeeq1_freq=2200 //EQ band for vibratoeq1_bw=2lfo01_eq1gain_oncc21=3 //Again, pretty subtlelfo02_wave=1 //Second LFO to make things wobblierlfo02_phase=0lfo02_phase_oncc131=0.7 //Phase affected by velocity, to pseudo-randomize while keeping both mics' LFOs in synclfo02_freq=0.01 //Basically no movement at very slow speeds, just randomizationlfo02_freq_oncc117=1 //Max rate is not very high, so it doesn't sound too obviouslfo02_pitch_oncc117=6 //Slight pitch wobblinesslfo02_freq_lfo01_oncc117=1 //Affect the rate of the other LFO for unsteady vibratolfo03_wave=1 //And a third LFO for secondhand complex wobblinesslfo03_phase=0.4lfo03_phase_oncc131=0.479 //Different phase response to velocity than the second LFOlfo03_freq=0.5lfo03_freq_oncc117=-0.4lfo03_freq_lfo2_oncc117=1lfo03_pitch_oncc117=-4```Something similar to the above will work fairly well for a range of strings and voices.However, there are cases where vibrato should only go in one direction - for example,bending guitar strings only moves the pitch upwards, while on saxophone it's possibleto play vibrato centered around the pitch, but most of the time players will go onlybelow the pitch. Let's use saxophone vibrato as an example.To have vibrato which will go below the main pitch is simple - the LFO phase can beset so the wave starts at the top, and the note [tuned](/opcodes/tune) down by the vibrato depth amount.```lfo01_pitch_oncc111=20lfo01_phase=0.25lfo01_freq=1.5lfo01_freq_oncc112=6pitch_oncc111=-20```This will work fine, as long as we don't try to apply delay or fade to the LFO, whichwould result in the note starting out flat with no vibrato. To solve that problem, wecan combine the LFO with a pitch [envelope](/types/envelope_generators.html). Here is an example with just delay:```lfo01_pitch_oncc111=20lfo01_freq=1.5lfo01_freq_oncc112=6lfo01_phase=0.25lfo01_delay_oncc116=1pitcheg_delay_oncc116=1pitcheg_depth_oncc111=-20```To have the choice of idiomatic sax vibrato and violin-style vibrato centered around the pitchcan be done separate LFOs and separate depth controls. It's also possible to duplicate all theregions and use [loccN/hiccN](/opcodes/loccN.html) to select between ones with different styles of vibrato.```lfo01_pitch_oncc111=20 //Sax vibrato LFO - goes down from the main pitchlfo01_freq=1.5lfo01_freq_oncc112=6lfo01_phase=0.25 //Starts at toplfo01_delay_oncc116=1pitcheg_delay_oncc116=1 //Pitch envelope to drop the central pitch when sax vibrato kicks inpitcheg_depth_oncc111=-20lfo02_pitch_oncc114=20 //Violin vibrato LFO - goes below and above main pitchlfo02_freq=1.5lfo02_freq_oncc112=6 //Same rate as the first LFOlfo02_phase=0.5 //Starts in the middle, goes down first before going uplfo02_delay_oncc116=1 //Same delay, too```This covers jaw vibrato, but sax players also use diaphragm vibrato, which changes volumeand has no effect on pitch, which means there are now three vibrato depths. Having thevolume modulated by the second LFO is a little easier, as the phase setting of the firstLFO would mean having to apply a volume envelope as well.```lfo01_pitch_oncc111=20 //Sax vibrato LFO - goes down from the main pitchlfo01_freq=1.5lfo01_freq_oncc112=6lfo01_phase=0.25 //Starts at toplfo01_delay_oncc116=1pitcheg_delay_oncc116=1 //Pitch envelope to drop the central pitch when sax vibrato kicks inpitcheg_depth_oncc111=-20lfo02_pitch_oncc114=20 //Violin vibrato LFO - goes below and above main pitchlfo02_freq=1.5lfo02_freq_oncc112=6 //Same rate as the first LFOlfo02_delay_oncc116=1 //Same delay, toolfo02_phase=0.5 //Starts in the middle, goes down first before going uplfo02_volume=0 //This LFO also does tremololfo02_volume_oncc113=3```There is one additional consideration with diaphragm vibrato - whenthe volume of the note drops down, the breath noise can become more prominent, especially on quiet notes or when using the subtone technique. If the volume of the breath noise can bemodulated separately, the noise regions should not be affected by pitch vibrato, and beaffected by the diaphragm vibrato in an opposite direction to the notes. So, if the abovevibrato settings are set under a [global header](/headers/global.html), the breath noisesample regions could have settings similar to this.```lfo01_pitch_oncc111=0 //LFOs do not affect pitchpitcheg_depth_oncc111=0lfo02_pitch_oncc114=0lfo02_volume_oncc113=-3 //Diaphragm vibrato affects volume in the opposite direction```Humanization and having the diaphragm vibrato affect timbre can be done similarly as withthe strings above, ensuring both LFOs are humanized in sync with each other, so they do notdrift apart.Some instruments will have vibrato types which require special treatment, for example guitartremolo bridges will bend each string's pitch by a different amount when playing chords. Thisrequires different pitch modulation depths for each string. Vibrato can also be used tomodulate [filter cutoffs](/opcodes/cutoff), which is commonly used in synthesizers to createevolving pads or wobble basses. This is not difficult to implement. Here is an example of asynthesizer style vibrato with a typical lowpass filter, and vibrato which can affect pitch,volume or filter cutoff.```//Filter//Lowpass filtercutoff=120cutoff_cc120=13200fil_keytrack=100resonance=0resonance_cc121=12//Vibratolfo01_freq=1lfo01_freq_oncc112=11lfo01_delay_oncc115=0.500lfo01_fade_oncc116=0.500lfo01_pitch_oncc111=22 //Vibrato LFO affects pitchlfo01_volume_oncc114=6 //Volume tremololfo01_cutoff=0 //Filter wobblelfo01_cutoff_oncc113=3600```This by no means exhausts all the possibilties of vibrato. It does provide a decent combination of control and realism for a lot of common instrument types.",

		"content": "## IntroductionThis page has the purpose to document the SFZ Format project website and givereferences and rules for maintainance.## GitHub and Travis-CIThe webpage is hosted on [GitHub] using [Git SCM]as content management, using 2 git repositories: source and master.The source repository is used for the website source files written in [Markdown]format and [Liquid] language, which are used by [Jekyll],a static pages website generator created and used by GitHub for hostingproject websites.The master repository is used to store the generated files that are builtexternally by Travis Continuous Integration service.[Travis-CI] was choosed instead GitHub Pages to enable the use of Jekyll customplugins required for our purposes, following their [GitHub Pages Deployment]documentation.## Rules- Start any .md file with a 2 triple-dashed lines [front matter],  otherwise Jekyll will copy the original md file into the resulting `_site`  directory.  Opcode files should include:  - a `layout: sfz/opcode` variable to specify the    required layout to build the resulting html page  - the page language code if it's not English  - optionally, the title of the page if different than the page name    (see the example below).- Each opcode file must have also an entry in the [syntax.yml] db file.- Using block code three back ticks even with a single line, inline code is used  for opcode keywords highlights.- Using spaces instead of tabs for indentation in pages, mostly on `_config.yml`  to avoid issues / unwanted results.- Using 80 characters per line limit for a better reading.- Using a naming convention for numbered opcodes starting with N following with  X Y Z, e.g.: `egN_timeX_onccY`- Don't use '' in md files to avoid the parser to generate wrong html  code, use '‹' and '›' instead.## Content### Opcode File ExampleIn case the opcode doesn't have any modulation and it has some associatedopcode like on_loccN / on_hiccN, then using `title` is the right choice.Otherwise use `opcode_name`, so a modulation documentation file (a symlink to theopcode it modulates in source code) will use the correct references.---layout: \"sfz/opcode\"lang: \"en\"title: \"lovel / hivel\"---(Here the auto-generated brief text description from syntax.yml db...)This is just an example for an opcode extended description to be written in some/opcodes/lovel.md markdown file.This text is readable on any editor, with low or high resolutions.## Examples```lovel=value1hivel=value2```(Here the auto-generated description table from syntax.yml db...)---layout: \"sfz/opcode\"opcode_name: \"volume\"---...## Examples```...```(auto-generated table ->) Modulations: volume_onccN ...## YAML Configuration FilesThe main [_config.yml] configuration file is placed in the root of the source repo.It is used by Jekyll to store its configuration options, but it can also be usedfor user custom options as well.Other configuration files are placed in the `_data` directory, used for otherwebsite contexts, like translation strings, navigation menu, aside blocks,and other SFZ related data files.### Translation filesThe `/_data/locale/` directory contains all files used for websitelanguage translation subdivided by language codes as subdirectories.Currently each language translation subdirectory contains 2 files:- `layout.yml`: contains both the navigation menu links and the aside card blocks\tstrings- `translation.yml`: contains all the language related translation strings used\tby default in the website pages.#### `layout.yml` navigation and cards sectionThe `navigation` section is used by the `_includes/navigation.html` layout pageto build the navigation menu. It recognizes the following variable structure:- title: The menu title- type:  The menu type, can be normal for simple links or dropdown for submenus,         identified by an arrow down icon.- url:   Normal links only, the URL of the link.- pages: Submenus container. An empty item, using just a hyphen,         creates a menu separator.The `cards` section is used by the `_includes/cards.html` layout page to buildthe aside [card] blocks on the right side of most of the website pages to placevarious internal and external links.It's very similar to the navigation one with few differences:- title: The card header title- icon_type: A Font Awesome icon type name, e.g. \"github\"- icon_category: The category of the FA icon  - fas: solid icon  - fab: brand icon- links: The contained card links.### SFZ related YAML filesThe `/_data/sfz/` directory contains all YAML files used for SFZ related data.#### `syntax.yml`The `headers` section is used by the `_includes/sfz/headers-table-generator.html`to build `/headers/index.md` description tables:- name: The header name- version: The SFZ version (see below)The `opcodes` section is used by different files as database information for allknown opcodes, including extension ones.The data is accessible from the `site.data.sfz.syntax.opcodes` and `site.data.sfz.syntax.headers` Liquid variables.There are various possible variables, which most are not mandatory, so if someopcode doesn't includes a feature, it can be omitted, resulting in Liquid code as`variable-name == nil`.Currently possible values are:- name: the opcode name.- short_description: a brief opcode description used to describe all opcodes  included in the related SFZ version/extension page.- version: SFZ version or extension, one of:  - SFZ v1  - SFZ v2  - ARIA  - Cakewalk- alias: if the opcode has some alias in other specification version.- value:  - type_name: Value type (string, integer, float etc.), `mandatory` for opcodes.  - default:   An optional default value.  - min:       An optional range minimum value.  - max:       An optional range maximum value.  - unit:      Value unit (seconds, decibels, cents etc.).- modulation:  - envelope: true (bool, without double quotes) if unspecified but present,              otherwise the name of modulation (string).  - lfo: same as for envelope.  - midi_cc:    - name: the ccN related opcode event name.    - version: the opcode modulation SFZ versionFor more details, check the file for additional variable options.[Git SCM]:                 https://git-scm.com/[GitHub]:                  https://github.com/sfzformat/sfzformat.github.io[GitHub Pages Deployment]: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pages/[Jekyll]:                  https://jekyllrb.com/[Liquid]:                  https://shopify.github.io/liquid/[Markdown]:                https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax[Travis-CI]:               https://travis-ci.com[front matter]:            https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/[syntax.yml]:              #syntaxyml[_config.yml]:             https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/[card]:                    https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/",
